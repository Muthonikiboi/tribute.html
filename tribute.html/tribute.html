<h1>Biography</h1>
        <p>Any keen follower of vernacular kikuyu comedy will agree with me that Frank Kimani fondly referred to as Wandahuhu by his legion of fans is definitely the most successful Kikuyu actor /comedian.

            Wandahuhu is a name given to someone who's generally arrogant and gluttonous a character he adopted so perfectly that his fans barely know his real name.
            
            Frank is no doubt talented something that has enabled him earn different roles in various TV drama series and local films.
            
            Many will remember the film "uyu ni Mwariguo" where he perfectly played the role of a sturbon crafty father who ruled his family by an iron rod .

Away from vernacular based shows and films, Wandahuhu has featured prominently in local TV shows Mheshimiwa and most notably in NTV drama series Varshita where he played the role of a landlord going by the name of Wang'ombe.

What many didn't know about Wandahuhu is the fact that unlike many actors who progress from theatre to TV, his was the opposite having been thrown straight into TV with zero experience but his talent saw him excell effortlessly.
With the covid 19 pandemic having stalled activities in both theatres and production of shows, Wandahuhu has diversified to other income generating ventures.

According to a colleague, Wandahuhu is a landlord in real life and the covid 19 break has enabled him to invest in real estate. He is currently supervising a four storey building within Nairobi which is expected to be completed come March next year.

As an ardent fan of Wandahuhu I can't wait to occupy his new apartments and witness his real self as a landlord.</p>
